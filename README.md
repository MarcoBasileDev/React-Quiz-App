This repository contains a simple quiz application built with React. The quiz is designed to test your knowledge of React fundamentals, including state management, user input handling, recording answers, and the use of side effects and the useEffect hook. While the primary function of the app is to offer users a quiz experience, its development served several key purposes:

## Purpose of the Application

### Knowledge Consolidation and Strengthening

The primary objective behind creating this quiz application was to solidify and strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals. By conceptualizing, designing, and implementing a quiz interface, I was able to reinforce my knowledge of state management, user input handling, and other core concepts in React development.

### Practice with State Management and User Input Handling

Through the development of this application, I gained valuable hands-on experience in managing state within React components. Understanding how to effectively handle user input and manage state changes is essential for building interactive and responsive applications. By implementing features such as recording and displaying user answers, I deepened my understanding of state management in React.

### Exploration of Side Effects and useEffect Hook

The inclusion of side effects and the useEffect hook in this project allowed me to explore asynchronous behavior and lifecycle management in React. By incorporating features such as timers for answering questions within a specified timeframe, I delved into the practical application of side effects and useEffect hook in React development. This hands-on experience was instrumental in broadening my understanding of React's lifecycle and its impact on application behavior.

## About the Application

The React Quiz App is designed to provide users with an engaging quiz experience, focusing on React fundamentals. Users can navigate through multiple-choice questions, answer within a specified time limit, and receive immediate feedback on their responses. Upon completion, the application presents users with their quiz score, providing a comprehensive overview of their performance.
